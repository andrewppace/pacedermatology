  body: "Indoor tanning is one of the worst things you can do to your skin.  It dramatically increases your risk of skin cancer.  The beds themselves emit a broad spectrum of UV rays.  There are no standardized safety precautions in the industry.  And recently, there has been a tax levied on their use.  So please avoid skin cancer and premature photo aging by not using tanning beds."

One small portion of this is that doctors may begin using electronic medical records and the government will reimburse them for some of the cost of setting this up.

  body: "There has been a long and ongoing debate about the best way to diagnose suspicious pigmented lesions.  The two most hotly debated methods are the punch biopsy or the broad shave biopsy.  The punch offers the benefits of a line scar and is capable of going deeper than the shave so there is less risk of obscuring the depth of the melanoma.  The downside to the punch biopsy is that large lesions are only partially sampled resulting in what is called sampling error.  The shave biopsy has the benefit that it can sample larger lesions and does not have this, sampling error, but does not go as deep so the depth, which gives prognostic information, may be inaccurate if the lesion is transected.  There is a third option that some dermatologist prefer and that is to do a narrow excision on suspicious lesions, this is gets out big lesions completely and gives there depth, but the major down side is that it often results in larger scars than may have been needed if the lesion indeed turns out to be a benign mole.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, no one way to sample a mole is correct.  Research in the future may change this but for now, discuss the options with your doctor and make the decision that is best in your situation."

The state's step towards the prevention of skin cancers is based on scientific evidence that the use of indoor tanning booths is undoubtedly related to melanoma and other skin cancers.  The president of the American Academy of Dermatology, who is also a New York-based dermatologist, is hoping that by limiting the use of indoor tanning for young teens they will be less likely to form tanning habits that will be carried on into adulthood.\r\n\r\nRead full article from the <a href=\"http://www.aad.org/stories-and-news/news-releases/new-york-prohibits-indoor-tanning-for-minors-under-17\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Dermatology</a>"

The Department of Defense wanted to find something similar to a sunblock for soldiers to use on their face that would protect them from the heat wave in road-side bomb blasts. When exposed to heat, the new substance protects the skin from heat for 15 seconds. The paint also includes a non-flammable form of DEET which repels insects. The preliminary tests have been passed by the new camo make-up and scientists are determining whether or not to continue testing.  There may be applications for firefighters as well.  (via <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/249354.php\">Medical News Today</a>)"

  body: "Having a healthy and stable skin care routine is one of the best ways to help reduce acne flare-ups. The American Academy of Dermatology has seven tips that have been recommended by dermatologists to help care for acne prone skin.  If you skin does not respond to these basic steps please consider making an appointment with a dermatologist.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure to wash twice a day and after sports or sweating.\r\n\r\n2. Always wash your face gently using your fingertips and with a non-abrasive cleanser.  Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide cleansers are often quite effective.  Acne scrubs are generally not recommended more than once a week.\r\n\r\n3. Water temperature is not critical, but rinsing with lukewarm water is probably best.\r\n\r\n4. If you have oily hair, make sure you shampoo regularly since areas where it touches your face will be especially prone to acne breakouts.\r\n\r\n5. Do not pick at acne lesions.  Letting your skin heal naturally is faster and lessens the chance of permanent scarring.\r\n\r\n6. Keeping your hands off your face will reduce break-outs.\r\n\r\n7. Limit sun exposure and always avoid tanning booths!\r\n\r\nRead more from the <a href=\"http://www.aad.org/stories-and-news/news-releases/want-clearer-skin-reduce-acne-by-following-these-top-tips-from-dermatologists\">American Academy of Dermatology</a>"

  body: "The cooler months mean the heaters are about to come on.  When this happens they tend to pull moisture out of the air, making fall and winter the worst times for dry skin.  Conditions like eczema, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis tend to flare up at this time of year.  Some basic dry skin care steps are outlined below.  The first 7 are good general principles most people can benefit from, the last few items are for people with the most severe dryness.\r\n\r\n1. Use moisturizers such as Vanicream (<a title=\"Vanicream\" href=\"http://www.pacedermatology.com/products-page/moisturizer/vanicream/\">BUY NOW</a>), best for people with very sensitive skin, or Cerave (<a title=\"CeraVe Cream\" href=\"http://www.pacedermatology.com/products-page/moisturizer/cerave-cream/\">BUY NOW</a>) a more general purpose slightly lighter cream, Eucerin cream, Cetaphil cream, Aquaphor or Vaseline petroleum jelly several times a day, especially after bathing or washing to lock-in moisture.  In general creams are better than lotions.\r\n2. Use very little soap, and only in areas needed. Use a mild soap such as Dove sensitive skin bar soap.  If your skin is very dry, Cetaphil cleanser is an alternative to Dove soap.\r\n3. Do Not vigorously scrub with a washcloth, sponge, or brush.\r\n4. Reduce bathing time to 5 minutes, and always apply a moisturizer immediately after bathing.\r\n5. Use lukewarm water-avoid hot or cold water.\r\n6. After bathing or washing, PAT your skin with a towel to dry gently.\r\n7. Do not use bubble bath.\r\n8. Do not use colognes, perfumes, sprays, powders etc. on your skin.\r\n9. Use unscented laundry products- both detergents and fabric softeners. If dry skin or inflammation persists with lubrication or prescription medication, you can also double rinse clothes after washing.\r\n10. Prescription creams and ointments should be applied to affected areas. Moisturizers are best applied at different times: if applied at the same time as prescription ointments or creams, always apply the prescription medication first.\r\n11. Do not wear tight or rough clothing. Wool clothes and new clothes can be irritating.\r\n12. Avoid saunas and steam baths\r\n13. For extreme dryness, a humidifier or vaporizer may help. Remember to keep it clean or molds may spread throughout the humidified area."

Rosacea, particularly the redness of rosacea is worsened with alcohol because it dilates blood vessels.\r\n\r\nCookies: All that sugar and chocolate affects our appearances too! Sugar deteriorates collagen and also can make our skin appear dull. High glycemic index foods have been linked to acne as well. Chocolate as with any high sugar food, may trigger acne breakouts.  It is thought that the insulin and growth hormone fluctuations with high glycemic index foods are the etiology of the acne flares.\r\n\r\n<strong>Don't worry too much, some holiday foods are good!</strong>\r\n\r\nSweet Potatoes: A delicious food that is high in Vitamin C which encourages the production of collagen and as an antioxidant can help wrinkles and has great general anti-aging properties.\r\n\r\nCocoa Powder and Dark Chocolate: While we said that chocolate is a bad holiday treat, it can be good too! Cocoa powder tends to be made of dark chocolate which is better for your skin. The antioxidants in dark chocolate, called flavonoids, help protect you against sun damage and also reduce the roughness of your skin.  Dark chocolate is lower in sugar than milk chocolate varieties as well.\r\n\r\nRead more about the good foods <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2012/05/16/9-best-foods-for-your-skin\" target=\"_blank\">here </a>.\r\nMore on the effects of <a href=\"http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-and-you/health/how-alcohol-affects-your-appearance\" target=\"_blank\">alcohol.</a>\r\nAnd more on your favorite <a href=\"http://healthylivingtalk.org/relationship-skin-care-sweets.html\" target=\"_blank\">sugars.</a>"
